## Introduction to Sets

A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. It is defined by curly braces `{}` and can contain various data types such as integers, strings, tuples, and more. Sets are commonly used for tasks that involve eliminating duplicate elements, membership testing, and performing mathematical set operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.

## Introduction to Dictionaries

A dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Each key in a dictionary must be unique and immutable, while values can be of any data type and mutable. Dictionaries are implemented using a hash table, which allows for efficient retrieval of values based on their keys. They are widely used for mapping and associating related information.

## Usage

To use sets and dictionaries in Python, simply create them using curly braces `{}` and specify the elements or key-value pairs within. You can perform various operations and methods on sets and dictionaries to manipulate and retrieve data efficiently.

```python
# Creating a set
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Creating a dictionary
my_dict = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2', 'key3': 'value3'}

# Performing operations on sets
intersection_set = set1.intersection(set2)
union_set = set1.union(set2)
difference_set = set1.difference(set2)

# Performing operations on dictionaries
value = my_dict['key']
my_dict['new_key'] = 'new_value'
del my_dict['key_to_delete']
```

## Examples

Check out the `examples` directory for practical examples demonstrating the usage of sets and dictionaries in Python. Each example includes detailed comments explaining the code and its output.
